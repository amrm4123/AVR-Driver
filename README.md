## Introduction

The Atmega32 Drivers repository aims to simplify the development process for projects based on the Atmega32 microcontroller. It provides reusable and well-documented driver libraries for common peripherals, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about low-level hardware configurations.


## Features

The Atmega32 Drivers repository currently includes drivers for the following peripherals:

- GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
- Timers (Timer/Counter modules)
- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

Each driver provides a set of functions and configuration options to initialize and control the respective peripheral.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `driver-name/` - Contains the source code, header files, and example code for a specific driver.
- `examples/` - Provides usage examples and demonstrations for each driver.
- `docs/` - Contains additional documentation, including datasheets, pinouts, and application notes.
- `LICENSE` - The license file for the Atmega32 Drivers repository.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview and instructions for using the drivers.

## Usage

To use a specific driver, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired driver directory:

    ```
    cd atmega32-drivers/driver-name
    ```

2. Include the necessary header file(s) in your application code:

    ```c
    #include "driver_name.h"
    ```

3. Configure the peripheral settings using the provided initialization functions.

4. Utilize the driver functions to interact with the peripheral:

    ```c
    // Example usage
    driver_init();     // Initialize the driver
    driver_enable();   // Enable the peripheral
    driver_write();    // Write data to the peripheral
    ```

5. Refer to the driver's header file and example code for detailed documentation and usage examples specific to each driver.
